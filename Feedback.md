# Tutor session

## 1, ML client in container

We don't need to put ML client into containers, as far as what tutor got from the professor but since it's on the instructions that we should put it into container. We are waiting for professor's reply.

## 2, Docker compose

For the docker compose, if we are using ML clients in the container, there should be three services in total:

```bash
database
ML client
web-app
```

For the database, it's not the language database, but the overall history of text translation instead.

## 3, Docker database

We are doing the correct way of building up the database and the connection by pymongo is correct.
